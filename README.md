In this seminar we have worked with the Big Bunk Bunny video and ffmpeg:

### Exercise 1

We have cut the first 10 seconds of the BBB video and we saved in a new mp4 file. In the ex1 folder you can find the commands used in a screenchot and the ouput mp4 video. 
### Exercise 2
---
From the output in exercise 1, we have extracted its YUV histogram which you can find in ex2.mp4 file. Then, we have created a new video where the histogram and the 10 seconds video are displayed simultaneously. All the output files and the screenshots showing the commands used can be found in the ex2 folder.
